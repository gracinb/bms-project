Team Members: Dominic, Brian Gracin, Shafkat Haque

To accomplish the nine tasks and a GUI in a effecient manner; we divided the tasks among each other and used a repository on GitHub to collaborate on the project and maintained communication through text. We have met everytime we've had class for a few minutes either before or after class to talk about the progress with the project and if anyone was having trouble.

Dominic: Completed problems 1,2,6 and developed the GUI. I gained more knowledge in PL/SQL and the various components one is able to create as well as, interfacing with a Oracle database using a GUI.

Brian:

Shafkat: Did problem 7 and 9 for PL/SQL. I gained more experience using GitHub and learned how to create a trigger, a procedure and calling SQL statements using JDBC.
