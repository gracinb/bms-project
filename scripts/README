Preparing work space:
Start sqlplus in the folder containing the PL/SQL files and run refresh (The second line in refresh.sql calls the file to drop/create the tables, one is included with tables from demo)

start refresh
commit;

This will drop everything and bring everything back up in the correct order.
Then exit sqlplus and compile the java files:

javac addCustomer.java
javac addPurchase.java
javac deletePurchase.java
javac monthlySales.java
javac printTables.java
javac purchaseSaving.java
javac Menu.java
javac startUpScreen.java

Then run the java program with:

java startUpScreen

This will start the java app prompting a login, once logged in use GUI to perform actions.

Known issues from demo: When purchasing an item if the amount input is greater than amount in stock GUI states success but transaction is stopped in the PL/SQL.
						The number of visits column in customers is not updated when a purchase is returned.
